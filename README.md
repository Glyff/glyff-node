## Building the source

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the official
Glyff-node [Installation
Instructions](https://github.com/Glyff/glyff-node/wiki/Building-Glyff)
on the wiki. Additionally, glyff depends on JPMorgan Chase's ZSL on Quorum,
with its own set of [build
requirements](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/zsl-q#building).

Building glyff requires both a Go (version 1.8 or later) and a C/++ compiler.
You can install them using your favourite package manager. Once the
dependencies are installed, run

    make glyff


## Executables

The glyff project executable is found in the `cmd` directory.

| Command    | Description |
|:----------:|-------------|
| **`glyff`** | Our main Glyff CLI client. It is the entry point into the Glyff network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default) archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Glyff network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `glyff --help` for command line options. |


## Running glyff

### Full node on the Glyff private testnet

At this moment in time, Glyff runs as a permissioned private testnet, which means partecipants have to be whitelisted before connecting to our seed nodes. Request access to the private testnet [here](https://glyff.io.com/Glyff/glyff-node/wiki/Building-Glyff)

To enable simple interaction withe Glyff network, such as : create accounts; transfer funds; deploy and interact with contracts. For this particular use-case
the user doesn't care about years-old historical data, so we can fast-sync quickly to the current
state of the network. To do so:

```
$ glyff console
```

This command will:

 * Start glyff in fast sync mode (default, can be changed with the `--syncmode` flag), causing it to
   download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history of the Glyff network,
   which is very CPU intensive.
 * Start up Glyff's built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/JavaScript-Console),
   (via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can invoke all official [`web3` methods](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API)
   as well as Glyff's own [management APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Management-APIs).
   This too is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already running Glyff instance
   with `glyff attach`.



### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `glyff` binary, you can also pass a configuration file via:

```
$ glyff --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to export your existing configuration:

```
$ glyff --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

#### Docker quick start

One of the quickest ways to get Glyff up and running on your machine is by using Docker:

```
docker run -d --name glyff-node -v /Users/alice/glyff:/root \
           -p 8545:8545 -p 30303:30303 \
           glyff/glyff
```

This will start glyff in fast-sync mode with a DB memory allowance of 1GB just as the above command does.  It will also create a persistent volume in your home directory for saving your blockchain as well as map the default ports. There is also an `alpine` tag available for a slim version of the image.

Do not forget `--rpcaddr 0.0.0.0`, if you want to access RPC from other containers and/or hosts. By default, `glyff` binds to the local interface and RPC endpoints is not accessible from the outside.

### Programatically interfacing Glyff nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you'll want to start interacting with Glyff and the Glyff
network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid this, Glyff has built in
support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) and
[Glyff specific APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Management-APIs)). These can be
exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (unix sockets on unix based platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by Glyff, whereas the HTTP
and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a subset of APIs due to security reasons.
These can be turned on/off and configured as you'd expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--rpc` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--rpcaddr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: "localhost")
  * `--rpcport` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: 8545)
  * `--rpcapi` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: "eth,net,web3,zsl")
  * `--rpccorsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--wsaddr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: "localhost")
  * `--wsport` WS-RPC server listening port (default: 8546)
  * `--wsapi` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: "eth,net,web3,zsl")
  * `--wsorigins` Origins from which to accept websockets requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcapi` API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: "admin,debug,eth,miner,net,personal,shh,txpool,web3")
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to connect
via HTTP, WS or IPC to a Glyff node configured with the above flags and you'll need to speak [JSON-RPC](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)
on all transports. You can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based transport before
doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert Glyff nodes with exposed APIs!
Further, all browser tabs can access locally running webservers, so malicious webpages could try to
subvert locally available APIs!**
